        <h1 class="teal">Which substances should we be able and allowed to put into our bodies, and under what circumstances?</h1><br>
        
        <p>A drug is a substance that has known biological effects on animals or humans. The medical field and the law enforcement field have long struggled to come to a consensus on what America&rsquo;s policies on legal and illegal drugs should be.</p><br>
        
        <h2 class="teal">Should we decriminalize drug use?</h2><br>
        
        <p>For decades, drug use has been criminalized in America. People have been arrested left and right and forced to attend rehabilitation centers whether or not they wanted to. Oftentimes, though, people will be thrown in jail for drug use as opposed to being sent to rehab or otherwise receiving the help that they supposedly need.</p><br>

        <h2 class="teal">Should we legalize marijuana?</h2><br>
        
        <p>When folks talk about decriminalizing the possession, sale and usage of drugs, they often talk about legalizing marijuana. Marijuana is a plant, otherwise known as cannabis, that can be smoked or eaten in order to produce a high, or otherwise good, light feelings, in the consumer. Currently, marijuana is completely legalized in Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, and has been decriminalized in many other states. Other states have legalized the use of medical marijuana, but have still outlawed recreational use.</p><br>

        <h2  class="teal">What does this mean to me?</h2><br>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re still unsure where you stand on drug-related issues, ask yourself the following questions.</p>
        <ul class="c13 lst-kix_s8ujz8ov0lbb-0 start">
            <li class="c7"><strong>Do you personally like to smoke, eat or otherwise consume marijuana?</strong>&nbsp;If so, do you enjoy being paranoid about the police catching you while you&rsquo;re high? If not, is the fact that recreational marijuana is still currently illegal in many places preventing you from trying it?</li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>Would there be a supply and demand issue if cannabis did not have a supply and demand issue due to its illegalization?</strong>&nbsp;Currently most of the crime that occurs surrounding the issue of cannabis happens because it is a really scarce resource and costs a lot of money. </li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>Have you ever seen people kill each other or indulge in any form of violent crime over a common commodity like salad or bananas?</strong>&nbsp;These are common items that are mass produced. People don&rsquo;t usually kill each other over plants.</li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>What if cannabis, which is a natural plant, also grew in our forests like any other plant?</strong>&nbsp;What if people were allowed to consume it like any other plant? </li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>If recreational marijuana is legalized, do you trust people to not drive or engage in other activities that are dangerous while they&rsquo;re high? </strong>Alcohol is legal, and drunk driving occurs today. Alcohol was illegal during Prohibition in the 1920s, and people still drank it and sometimes probably even drove after they drank.</li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>If you were caught smoking marijuana or doing some other not deadly drug, do you think you would deserve to go to jail?</strong>&nbsp;</li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>If you or someone you know was suffering with a drug addiction, would it be more helpful to go to jail or to go to rehab?</strong></li>
            <li class="c7"><strong>If you depended on the government to help you financially, would it be fair for you to be spending that money on marijuana or other drugs?</strong></li>
        </ul>
